Lab 7

Purpose: To practice creating and using a makefile. To practice using arrays and structures.

Conclusions:

a) What I learned from this lab:
I learned how to utilize structures and arrays to calculate things such as the 
number of sundays that land on the first of the month between given years. I also 
learn how to use fgets and sscanf to take and interpret input from the user. I 
also learned how to make a makefile and use it to compile all of my programs 
quickly and easily.

b) How did the pair programming help/hinder the lab:
The pair programming helped me a lot when it came to the makefile. Before the 
pair programming I had no idea what is was and how to use it. Afterwards I 
realized how useful it was to have one.

c) Issues and how I fixed them (bug report):
I had a lot of trouble with the zombies program at first. I was trying to modify 
the strucure I passed into my function but found that it had not been modified 
outside of my function. I was puzzled with why I was getting garbage values before 
I realized this. I fixed it by passing in a pointer to the structure I was trying 
to modify.

d) Improvements that can be made:
In the future, I can improve my programs by making them more efficient overall.
For example, I would like to separate my zombie log program into more functions 
than were listed in the requirements.
